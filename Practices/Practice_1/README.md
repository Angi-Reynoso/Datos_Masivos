## LINEAR REGRESSION EXERCISE

## Instructions: 

1. Import LinearRegression
~~~
import org.apache.spark.ml.regression.LinearRegression
~~~

2. Optional: Use the following code to configure errors 
~~~
import org.apache.log4j._
Logger.getLogger("org").setLevel(Level.ERROR)
~~~
>`log4j._` It is an additional library that allows our application to display information messages about what is happening in it. 

>`getLogger`It is a method of a Logger class used find or create a logger. 

3. Start a simple Spark Session
> The entry point into all functionality in Spark is the `SparkSession` class. To create a basic SparkSession, just use `SparkSession.builder()`
~~~
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
val spark = SparkSession.builder().getOrCreate()
~~~

4. Use Spark for the Clean-Ecommerce csv file.
~~~
val data  = spark.read.option("header","true").option("inferSchema", "true").format("csv").load("Clean-Ecommerce.csv")
~~~
> First declare a variable (df) to which the file to be loaded will be assigned.  
`spark.read` is used to load a CSV file into Spark.  
`.option ("header", "true")` is used to load file headers.  
`.option ("inferSchema", "true")` helps Spark automatically infer data types from the file.  
 And finally in `csv("")` we put the name of the file and its extension, in this case _"Clean-Ecommerce.csv"_.  


5. Print the schema on the DataFrame.
~~~
data.printSchema
~~~
> `printSchema()` is used to display only existing columns and information about them

6. Print an example row from the DataFrane.
~~~
data.head(1)
val colnames = data.columns
val firstrow = data.head(1)(0)
println("\n")
println("Example data row")
for(ind <- Range(1, colnames.length)){
    println(colnames(ind))
    println(firstrow(ind))
    println("\n")
}
~~~
> `head()` is used to display the first N elements of the DataFrame.  

## Set up the DataFrame for Machine Learning

7. Transform the data frame so that it takes the form of ("label", "features")
Import VectorAssembler and Vectors
~~~
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vectors
~~~
> `VectorAssembler` is a transformer that combines a given list of columns into a single vector column. It is useful for combining raw features and features generated by different feature transformers into a single feature vector, in order to train ML models like logistic regression and decision trees.

> Factory methods for `org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector`. We don't use the name `Vector` because Scala imports `scala.collection.immutable.Vector` by default.  

8. Rename the Yearly Amount Spent column as "label"  
8.1 Also from the data take only the numerical column  
8.2 Leave all this as a new DataFrame called df  
~~~
val df = data.select(data("Yearly Amount Spent").as("label"),$"Avg Session Length",$"Time on App",$"Time on Website",$"Length of Membership")
~~~

9. Use the VectorAssembler object to convert the input columns of the df  
9.1 to a single output column of an array named "features"  
9.2 Configure the input columns from where we are supposed to read the values.  
9.3 Call this a new assambler.  
~~~
val assembler = new VectorAssembler().setInputCols(Array("Avg Session Length","Time on App","Time on Website","Length of Membership")).setOutputCol("features")
~~~

10. Use the assembler to transform our DataFrame to two columns: label and features
~~~
val output = assembler.transform(df).select($"label",$"features")
~~~

11. Create an object for line regression model.
~~~
val lr = new LinearRegression()
~~~
12. Fit the model for the data and call this model lrModel
~~~
val p1Model = lr.fit(output) //ajustar el output
~~~

13. Print the coefficients and intercept for the linear regression
~~~
println(s"Coefficients: ${lrModel.coefficients} Intercept: ${lrModel.intercept}")
~~~

14. Summarize the model on the training set print the output of some metrics!
Use our model's .summary method to create an object called trainingSummary
~~~
val trainingSummary = lrModel.summary
~~~

15. Show the residuals values, the RMSE, the MSE, and also the R ^ 2.
~~~
trainingSummary.residuals.show()
trainingSummary.predictions.show()
trainingSummary.r2 
trainingSummary.rootMeanSquaredError
~~~
>`residuals` The diferrence between the label and predicted value
>`r2` The coefficient of determination; a mesure of fit
>`rootMeanSquareError` Returns the root mean squared error, which is defined as the square root of the mean squared error.
