Therefore in the following practice the development of the 6 fibonacci algorithms will be carried out: 

Solution: 
Algorithm 1 Downward recursive version
If the number entered in the function is less than 2, the number entered will be returned to n
In any case that is greater than 2, the function will perform a series of operations,and return the result depending the number entered. 

Algorithm 2 Version with explicit formula
Algorithm 3 Iterative Version
Algorithm 4 Iterative version 2 variables
Algorithm 5 Vector iterative version
Algorithm 6 Version Divide and Conquer
