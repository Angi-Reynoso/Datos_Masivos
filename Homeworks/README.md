# Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient

Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not specifically identified.
The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, a measure that increases the value of one variable, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, a measure that increases the value of one variable, the value of the other reduces.

The Pearson correlation coefficient aims to indicate how associated two variables are associated with each other so:

* **Correlation less than zero:** If the correlation is less than zero, it means that it is negative, that is, that the variables are inversely related.  

* **When the value of one variable is high**, the value of the other variable is low. The closer to -1, the clearer the extreme covariation. If the coefficient is equal to -1, we refer to a perfect negative correlation.

* **Correlation greater than zero:** If the correlation is equal to +1 it means that it is perfect positive. In this case it means that the correlation is positive, that is, that the variables are directly correlated.
When the value of one variable is high, the value of the other is also high, the same happens when they are low. If it is close to +1, the coefficient will be covariation.

* **Correlation equal to zero:** when the correlation is equal to zero it means that it is not possible to determine some sense of covariation. However, it does not mean that there is no non-linear relationship between the variables.
When the variables are independent, it means that they are correlated, but this means that the result is true.
