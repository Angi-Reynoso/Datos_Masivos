## Instructions  

Develop the following instructions in Spark with the Scala programming language,
using only documentation from Spark's Machine Learning Mllib library and
Google

**1. Data**
* From the Iris.csv dataset found at https://github.com/jcromerohdz/iris.
* Elaborate the cleanliness of data necessary to be processed by the following algorithm.
* (Important, this cleaning must be by means of Scala script in Spark).

**a. Using Spark's Mllib library the Machine Learning Algorithm called Multilayer Perceptron**  

**2. What are the column names?**  

**3. How is the scheme?**  

**4. Print the first 5 columns.**  
**5. Use the describe() method to learn more about the data in the DataFrame.**  
**6. Make the corresponding transformation for the categorical data which will be our labels to classify.**  
**7. Build the classification models and explain your architecture.**  
**8. Print the model results.**
