## Instructions: 

1. Create a list called "list" with the elements "red", "white", "black".  
2. Add 5 more items to "list" "green", "yellow", "blue", "orange", "pearl".  
3. Bring the "list" "green", "yellow", "blue" items.  
4. Create a number array in the 1-1000 range in 5-in-5 steps. 
5. What are the unique elements of the "list" List (1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7) use conversion to sets.  
6. Create a mutable map called names that contain the following "JosÃ©", 20, "Luis", 24, "Ana", 23, "Susana", "27".  
  6a. Print all the map keys.  
  6b. Add the following value to the map ("Miguel", 23).  

## Solutions: 

### Solution 1:
A List was created, which has the name "list".
~~~
val list = List ("red", "white", "black")
println (list)
~~~
### Solution 2:  
The operator ": :" is used to build lists, in addition to the form used in the previous exercise.
~~~
val list1 = "green" :: "yellow" :: "blue" :: "orange" :: "pearl" :: list
~~~
### Solution 3:
The `slice()` method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object.  
The `slice()` method selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at, but does not include, the given end argument.
~~~
list.slice (0,3)
~~~
### Solution 4:
"Range" allows us to give you the range we want our arrangement to have.
~~~
Array.range (1,1000,5)
~~~
### Solution 5:
"toSet" gives us data that is not repeated or duplicated.
~~~
val list = List(1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7)
list.toSet
~~~
### Solution 6:
"Map# is a collection of key-value pairs. In other words, it is similar to dictionary.  
Keys are always unique while values need not be unique.  
Key-value pairs can have any data type. However, data type once used for any key and value must be consistent throughout.  
Maps are classified into two types: mutable and immutable.  
By default Scala uses immutable Map, in order to use mutable Map, we must import `scala.collection.mutable.Map` class explicitly.
~~~
val names = collection.mutable.Map (("Jose", 20), ("Luis", 24), ("Ana", 23), ("Susana", 27))
~~~
### Solution 6a:
"keys": This method returns an iterable containing each key in the map.
~~~
names.keys
~~~
### Solution 6b:
We can insert new key-value pairs in a mutable map using "+=" operator followed by new pairs to be added or updated.
~~~
names += ("Miguel" -> 23)
~~~
