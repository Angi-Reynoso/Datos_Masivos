## Instructions: 

1. Create a list called "list" with the elements "red", "white", "black".
2. Add 5 more items to "list" "green", "yellow", "blue", "orange", "pearl". Bring the "list" "green", "yellow", "blue" items.
3. Create a number array in the 1-1000 range in 5-in-5 steps. What are the unique elements of the List list (1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7) to     use conversion to sets.  
4. Create a mutable map called names that contain the following "JosÃ©", 20, "Luis", 24, "Ana", 23, "Susana", "27".
5. Print all the map keys.
6. Add the following value to the map ("Miguel", 23).

## Solutions: 

### Solution 1:
~~~
a list was created, which has the name "list"
val list = List ("red", "white", "black")
println (list)
~~~
### Solution 2:
~~~
val list1 = "green" :: "yellow" :: "blue" :: "orange" :: "pearl" :: list
~~~
### Solution 3:
The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object.
The slice() method selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at, but does not include, the given end argument.
~~~
list.slice (0,3)
~~~
### Solution 4:
"Range" allows us to give you the range we want our arrangement to have
~~~
Array.range (1,1000,5)
~~~

### Solution 5:
"toSet" gives us data that is not repeated or duplicated
~~~
val list = List(1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7)
list.toSet
~~~

### Solution 6:

~~~
val names = collection.mutable.Map (("Jose", 20), ("Luis", 24), ("Ana", 23), ("Susana", 27))
~~~
### Solution 6a:
~~~
names.keys
~~~
### Solution 6b:
~~~
names += ("Miguel" -> 23)
~~~
